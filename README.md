# lessis.moe v0.2.0
## Repo for my personal site

Yeah, I chose the domain because I liked the wordplay.

### Stack
- Node.js
- EJS
- WS

### Installation

`npm install`

### Running

`node web.js`

Then open `localhost:8080`

### Notes

Not public yet. Will be implemented once complete.

Still very much in-dev. For example, the `/api` endpoints are not yet implemented, 
since this is a complete rewrite of an existing site.
